def scoring_model(model_file: str, test_file: str, target_file: str):
    """
    Computation of mean RMSE loss, as used in the challenge for exercise 5. The targets are loaded from the specified
    "target_file" (pickle file containing list of numpy arrays), whereas the predictions are created using the model
    stored at "model_file" using the original testset input data stored at "test_file".
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    model_file : str
        File path of the stored (trained) model. The model must be in ONNX or TorchScript format (which one is
        determined by the file extension: ".onnx" for ONNX or ".pt" for TorchScript), and the model output must be the
        list of predictions, where each prediction is a 1D torch.Tensor object (not a numpy array!) of an arbitrary
        numeric datatype, containing the predicted missing pixel values. These predictions will then automatically be
        converted to a numpy array, its values will be clipped to range [0, 255], and the datatype will be cast to
        numpy's uint8. The input to the model will be the concatenated image data and the known array data from the
        original testset input data (see parameter "test_file"), and the batch size is fixed to 1, i.e., the input
        shape is (N=1, C=6, H=100, W=100).
        
        This parameter also controls the normalization that can be applied to the input image data, before it is passed
        to the model. If this option is enabled, de-normalization is also automatically performed on the model output,
        i.e., the predictions, before they are clipped to range [0, 255] and converted to a numpy uint8 array. The
        normalization is based on two user-specifiable values: "shift" and "scale". Normalization is then done by
        calculating "(x - shift) / scale" and de-normalization via "y * scale + shift", where "x" is the image input
        data and "y" is the model output data (the predictions). "shift" and "scale" can be specified directly by the
        filename of "model_file": To do so, simply provide a filename that somewhere contains "shift=A" and "scale=B",
        where "A" and "B" can be arbitrary integer or floating point numbers. Example: "model_scale=255shift=1.5.pt",
        which would translate to a "scale" of 255 and a shift of "1.5" (for a TorchScript model, in this case). If the
        two parameters are not specified, no scaling/shifting will be done.
        
        In case of an ONNX model, GPU acceleration is performed automatically. In case of a TorchScript model, the
        filename again determines whether to run the model on the CPU (default) or on the GPU. If the TorchScript model
        should be run on the GPU, the filename must contain "gpu" somewhere. Example: "model_gpu.pt", which would then
        lead to running the model on the GPU. Note that the original model must have been moved to the GPU prior to
        exporting as a TorchScript model, or otherwise, errors or even unexpected behavior might occur (see FAQ:
        https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#frequently-asked-questions).
    test_file: str
        File path of the original testset input data, which is a pickle file containing a dictionary with the following
        entries: "input_arrays" (list of numpy arrays), "known_arrays" (list of numpy arrays), "offsets" (list of
        integer 2-tuples), "spacings" (list of integer 2-tuples), "sample_ids" (list of strings). The file can
        optionally be compressed, which will be automatically determined based on its file extension, of which the
        following are supported:
        > ".zip": zip compression (https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html, including the requirement of the zlib
          module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html)
        > ".gz": gzip compression (https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html, also requires the zlib module)
        > ".bz2": bzip2 compression (https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html)
        > ".xz": lzma compression (https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html)
        If none of these file extensions match, it is assumed to be a raw pickle file.
    target_file: str
        File path of target file. Has to be a pickle file (or dill file) and contain a list of numpy arrays of dtype
        uint8, as specified in assignment sheet 2. The file can optionally be compressed (refer to "test_file" above
        for more details). This file will not be available for the challenge.
